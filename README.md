# Higher-Lower-game

The key idea behind the game is that system will randomly pick data about an entity from data.py file and show to user basic details such as name of entity, a breif description and the country they are based in.
The user will be prompted to put an input based on their guess that which of the two entities have higher follower count on instagram. 
If the user is correct then the score increases by 1 point and game continues if they are wrong then the game ends and final score is printed.
